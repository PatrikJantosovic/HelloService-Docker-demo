# HelloService - Docker - NodeJs/ExpressJS demo project

Simple and useless project to run a nodejs micro service in docker container.

ExpressJs is used, server listens to / or /:name endpoints and response with: Hello / Hello :name.

Dockerfile was created, image built and ran, to get some first time experience with docker.
